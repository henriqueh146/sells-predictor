The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate some concepts of machine learning and data science in a hands on approach. The data that will be used in this project comes from a kaggle competition. It aims to provide a machine learning model to predict the sells of a store. 

The model is intended to compose a system for financial management. I receives a the data and returns the sells prediction for the next year. It can be returned in graphic or table format to the system in order to compose a report or to a telegram chat in order to the user make quick queries.
